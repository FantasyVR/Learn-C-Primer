1.2 I can compile the .c file, and no error! It looks like 1.1,no different.
1.5 this test is same as 1.4 program
1.6 It is not legal, Because semicolon means this statement is finished.The right solution is remove the semicolone.

1.8 1st is legal, 2nd is legal, 3th is illegal, 4th is legal;

1.12 sum = 0
